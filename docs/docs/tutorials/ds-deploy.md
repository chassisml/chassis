# Deploy Model to KServe

!!! note
    If you just want to try Chassis, you can use the test drive, which will deploy Chassis and KServe for you so you can use Chassis to containerize an MLflow model, push it to your Docker Hub account, and then publish it to the KServe instance running inside the test drive, in the `kfserving.ipynb` sample notebook:

    <a href="https://testfaster.ci/launch?embedded=true&repo=https://github.com/combinator-ml/terraform-k8s-chassis&file=examples/testfaster/.testfaster.yml" target="_blank">:computer: Launch Test Drive :computer:</a>


## Install KServe in minikube

You just need to clone the KServe repository and run the `quick_install.sh` script.

```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kserve/kserve/release-0.7/hack/quick_install.sh" | bash
```

## Required variables

There are some environment variables that must be defined for KServe to work:

- INTERFACE: kserve
- HTTP_PORT: port where kserve will be running
- PROTOCOL: it can be v1 or [v2](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2)
- MODEL_NAME: a name for the model must be defined

## Deploy the model

Assuming the image generated by ChassisML has been uploaded to a
repository called `carmilso/chassisml-sklearn-demo:latest`, just deploy
the [file that defines the `InferenceService` for the protocol v1 of KServe](https://github.com/modzy/chassis/blob/main/service/flavours/mlflow/interfaces/kserve/custom_v1.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kubeflow.org/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: chassisml-sklearn-demo
spec:
  predictor:
    containers:
    - image: carmilso/chassisml-sklearn-demo:latest
      name: chassisml-sklearn-demo-container
      env:
        - name: INTERFACE
          value: kserve
        - name: HTTP_PORT
          value: "8080"
        - name: PROTOCOL
          value: v1
        - name: MODEL_NAME
          value: digits
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

In this case, the variable `MODEL_NAME` should not be necessary since it's defined when creating the image.

```bash
kubectl apply -f custom_v1.yaml
```

This should output a success message.

## Define required variables to query the pod

This is needed in order to be able to communicate with the deployed image.

The `SERVICE_NAME` must match the name defined in the `metadata.name` of the `InferenceService` created above.

The `MODEL_NAME` must match the name of your model. It can be defined by the data scientist when [making the request against `Chassis` service](https://chassis.ml/tutorials/ds-connect/) or overwritten in the `InferenceService` as defined above.

Mac:
```bash
minikube tunnel

# in another terminal:
export INGRESS_HOST=localhost
export INGRESS_PORT=80
```

Linux:
```bash
export INGRESS_HOST=$(minikube ip)
export INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')
```

Mac or Linux:
```bash
export SERVICE_NAME=chassisml-sklearn-demo
export MODEL_NAME=digits
export SERVICE_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl get inferenceservice ${SERVICE_NAME} -o jsonpath='{.status.url}' | cut -d "/" -f 3)
```

## Query the model

Please note that you must base64 encode each input instance. For example:

```python
import json
import base64 as b64
instances = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]]
input_dict = {'instances': [b64.b64encode(str(entry).encode()).decode() for entry in instances]}
json.dump(input_dict,open('kserve_input.json','w'))
```

Now you can just make a request to predict some data. Take into account that you must download [`inputsv1.json`](https://github.com/modzy/chassis/blob/main/service/flavours/mlflow/interfaces/kserve/inputsv1.json) before making the request. 

```bash
curl -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" "http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/${MODEL_NAME}:predict" -d@inputsv1.json | jq
```

The output should be similar to this:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "data": {
        "drift": null,
        "explanation": null,
        "result": {
          "classPredictions": [
            {
              "class": "4",
              "score": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "data": {
        "drift": null,
        "explanation": null,
        "result": {
          "classPredictions": [
            {
              "class": "8",
              "score": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "data": {
        "drift": null,
        "explanation": null,
        "result": {
          "classPredictions": [
            {
              "class": "8",
              "score": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "data": {
        "drift": null,
        "explanation": null,
        "result": {
          "classPredictions": [
            {
              "class": "4",
              "score": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "data": {
        "drift": null,
        "explanation": null,
        "result": {
          "classPredictions": [
            {
              "class": "8",
              "score": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this case, the data was prepared for the protocol v1, but we can deploy
the image using the protocol v2 and make the request using the [data for v2](https://github.com/modzy/chassis/blob/main/service/flavours/mlflow/interfaces/kserve/inputsv2.json).

## Deploy the model locally

The model can also be deployed locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
-e INTERFACE=kserve \
-e HTTP_PORT=8080 \
-e PROTOCOL=v2 \
-e MODEL_NAME=digits \
carmilso/chassisml-sklearn-demo:latest
```

So we can query it this way. Take into account that you must download [`inputsv2.json`](https://github.com/modzy/chassis/blob/main/service/flavours/mlflow/interfaces/kserve/inputsv2.json) before making the request:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/v2/models/digits/infer -d@inputsv2.json
```
