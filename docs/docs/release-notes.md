# Release Notes

## v1.5.0 <span class="pill-btn">beta</span>
*August 2023* :octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

v1.5 is now in beta. This release culminates a significant refactor of the Chassis codebase and results in faster build times and smaller, faster model containers.

 * Container build times are now 2-5x faster, especially for models with few `pip` dependencies
 * Model containers built with Chassis v1.5 are now up to 10x smaller (a 2-4x size reductions is more typical) than those generated by previous versions
 * Docker builds are now supported, so installing Chassis on a K8s cluster is no longer a requirement
 * The Chassis build server has been completely refactored: It is now fully configurable via Helm charts, no longer has an object storage dependency, supports multi-platform builds (e.g. `amd64`, `arm32v5`, `arm64v8`, etc.), and now uses considerably less CPU and RAM
 * The chassisml SDK has been completely rewritten, improving usability, performance, size, and number of extra dependencies
 * A convenience OMI client is now available that makes it easier to run inferences through OMI model containers
