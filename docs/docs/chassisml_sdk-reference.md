# Chassisml Python SDK

## Introduction

The Chassisml Python SDK offers convenience functions that interact with the Chassisml service to automate the containerization and deployment of models to your preferred model serving platform. It is organized into two classes: 

* `ChassisClient`: interacts with the Chassis routes that build a user's container from their model artifacts
* `ChassisModel`: creates a chassis compliant model out of a few lines of Python code from user supplied model artifacts 

First, install the Chassisml SDK to get started:

```pip install chassisml```

To import the library into your editor:

```import chassisml```
